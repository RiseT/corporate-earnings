*Corporate Earnings is a browser extension which displays earnings data in a format similar to MarketSmith*

### Installation Instructions
**Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Brave**
1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/huskytrader/corporate-earnings/archive/main.zip)
1. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `corporate-earnings-main`
1. In Chrome/Edge/Brave go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` or `brave://extensions`)
1. Enable Developer Mode
1. Drag the `corporate-earnings-main` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards)
1. Use the extension by pressing on extension icon to the right of address bar and entering a stock symbol in the popup dialog

### Troubleshooting
* If earnings data doesn't appear on top of the page, try refreshing the page and/or turning off adblocker
* On Windows make sure you have extracted the ZIP file not just listed it: right click on the ZIP and select 'Extract All...'. You may end up with an extra corporate-earnings-main folder. Make sure that folder that you drag into Chrome contains manifest.json file.
